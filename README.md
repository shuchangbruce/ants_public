# Ants vs. Some-Bees

This module is a simple turn-based tower-defense game played on the command-line, completed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW ISchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Spend some time reading through the provided code _carefully_ to make sure you understand it. After you've read the code, in the space below list any _design patterns_ we discussed in class that you can find (note that you may need to revisit the code after each lecture). Be clear about which pattern is used, where, and _why it is being employed_.

##### 2. After you've read the code, is there anywhere that it could be re-architected (e.g., using design patterns) to be more changeable or reusable? 
> Answer goes here!


##### 3. The tunnels in the `AntColony` are structured as a ___Linked List___ (where each element is a `Place`, and the `exit` and `entrance` variables are the traditional `next` and `prev`). Why is this data structure appropriate (as opposed to, say, an array). _You may need to revisit your notes from CSE 143._

##### 4. Describe the overall architecture you used to implement the different components of this assignment. Did you use inheritance? A particular design pattern?
> Answer goes here!


##### 5. Specifically, discuss your use of object-oriented design patterns in your program. What patterns did you use in your implementation (be specific)? Why? Is there anywhere you explicitly decided _not_ to use a pattern (e.g., because doing so would have made it more difficult to change the code later, etc)? Be detailed---you should reflect carefully on your own design and architecture work!
> Answer goes here!
> This should be a detailed write-up---probably a paragraph or two.


##### 6. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Answer goes here!


##### 7. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Answer goes here!


##### 8. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
